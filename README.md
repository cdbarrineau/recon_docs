# Cracker Recon Tools
Collection of documents I've collected that describe how to use various tools like standard Linux toolslike dig and speciality tools like nmap.

## Hacker != Cracker
There are many fundamental differences between a Hacker and a Cracker.  Up until the 1980's, there was a distinct difference.  During the mid 80's, many crackers (I assume they didn't like the name) started to call themselves Hackers.  The media has latched on to this as well and nowadays the term Hacker is associated with Bad Actors, those that want to break stuff, steal stuff, ya know, all illegal stuff.  This is NOT what a hacker truly is.  A Hacker is someone with a playful curiosity of how things work and are passionate about their craft and constantly work to improve it.  Anything can be hacked, even the word GNU is a recursive hack and stands for: GUN's not UNIX.  Even a carpenter can be a hacker though it's not that high-tech, if they have a passion for their craft, like to create things, and always work to get better, they are a hacker.

Cracker on the other hand likes to do to "bad things" as described above.  Hackers look down on crackers with disdain.  Hackers have no time for crackers.
